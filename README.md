# MyCalorieTracker

Our Calorie Tracker App is a tracker allows users to monitor their daily calorie intake and weight over time. This application allows users to create accounts, log calorie intake and weight, set and update calorie goals, and also track their progress. With the help of an external API, users can also retrieve nutritional information about the food items they consume, ensuring accurate tracking of their calorie intake.

The application integrates with the Calorie Ninjas API to fetch nutritional values for specific food items, providing precise insights into calories, proteins, carbohydrates, and sugars, which help users make informed dietary decisions.
